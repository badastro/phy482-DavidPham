# Feedback on Project Work
## David Pham

In this file, I will compile your feedback (and grade) for your project homework problems in reverse chronological order. Please do not alter this file and if you do, make sure to add and commit the new version to your repository before turning in the next assignment. Thanks, Danny

## Assignment 4

David, you did a great job of linking the studies you have read about together. So, thanks for taking on the feedback form last week. I think I am still wanting more detail into the studies: how the modeling is done, what specifically is MHD from a model perspective, and how might one related the general model in MHD to specifics that you have presented here. I think that's an important gap in your work so far - you assume that there's an understanding on the part of the reader on MHD, which is needed to understand the studies. My suggestion would be to think about what you have learned and what you have presented in terms of what someone would need to know to better understand the physics presented: MHD, convection, etc. In the next update, I'm hoping that you have expanded on what you have done here in that way.

## Assignment 3

David, the summaries that you have presented here follow a bitmore of the scaffold that I gave you, but I'm not sure if they are detailed enough to draw a synthesis across the articles as is expected of you this week. It might be that you have some tacit understanding of them, which allows you to bring them together, but it's not explict in your summaries. so, my advice in working on this week's assignment is that you think about what holds these papers together and how can you discuss them in turn. That will be quite important as you start to write your paper, of which this latest assignment is meant to form the basis of.

## Assignment 2

David, your summaries of these articles are comprhensive, but appear to focus on the results of the papers. It's not clear from these summaries what the phenomenon is...precisely...nor how it is modeled. I think that understanding the concept of MHD is important here. What does it mean and how does it work? What models are used to understand it? You've dove into articles that describe results, but I'm concerned that you are missing the forest through the trees. It's critical that in your paper you provide an overview of magnetohydrodynamics, and describe your understanding of it. For this week, I'd ask that you focus on that and try to understand it conceptually to be able to frame the results in the papers that you have and are reading.

## Assignment 1

David, magnetohydrodynamics is a field that is important many fields inclduing astronomy, fluid dynamics, and material science. I think this is an excellent topic, but also a very broad one. I think that narrowing to the magnetohydrodynamics in stellar objects would make a lot of sense, so that you don't end up with something too broad and unmanagable. I would suggest for this next homework that you summarize as much of the book that you are reading, but also begin to look for a review article around the phenomoneon of magnetohydrodynamics because you will want a deeper theoretical and experimental understanding of the field to discuss how it relates to stellar objects. I'm not sure about your book, but none of the papers that you proposed seem to be reviews. In fact one of them seems to be an entire symposium! Careful not to cast too wide a net.
