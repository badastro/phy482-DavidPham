## Assignment 1

David, magnetohydrodynamics is a field that is important many fields inclduing astronomy, fluid dynamics, and material science. I think this is an excellent topic, but also a very broad one. I think that narrowing to the magnetohydrodynamics in stellar objects would make a lot of sense, so that you don't end up with something too broad and unmanagable. i would suggest for this next homework that you summarize as miuch of the book that you are reading, but also begin to look for a review article around the phenomoneon of magnetohydrodynamics because you will want a deeper theoretical and experimental understanding of the field to discuss how it relates to stellar objects. I'm not sure about your book, but none of the papers that you proposed seem to be reviews. In fact one of them seems to be an entire symposium! Careful not to cast to wide a net.

* Score: 20/20
